Minimal Functionalities:
* ADMIN can:
	-add a user
	-delete a user
	-search a user
	-view/change user details
	-submit a item for auction

* USER(DEFAULT) can:
	-register for a account
	-bid on a auction item with money up front
	-update a existing bid
	-view bidding history
	-edit account details

* BIDS should be able to be:

Stretch Goals:
	-Package tracking of completed bids

	-Encrypted e-mail notifications
	-False auction page to hide black market
	-Users(DEFAULT) can submit a item for auction
	-Reactive design (i.e. friendly to a variety of views)
